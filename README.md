iOS Application GUID Name Resolver


Version 0.3

It is hard for humans to navigate around a file system constructed of GUIDs, so lets resolve their friendly package names (plus some other metadata) for easy lookup.

Now supports multiple output formats with the choice of parsing all applications or just 3rd party bundles

Supported output: csv, pandas_dataframe
